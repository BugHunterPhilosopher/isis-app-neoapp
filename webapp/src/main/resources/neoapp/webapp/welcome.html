    <a href="http://isis.apache.org" target="_blank">Apache Isis</a>&trade; is a platform to let you rapidly develop
    domain-driven apps in Java.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This app demonstrates how Apache Isis can be configured to persist using <a href="http://neo4j.com">Neo4J</a>, courtesy of
    its integration with <a href="http://datanucleus.org">DataNucleus</a>.

    <br/>
    <br/>
    The app itself consists of two domain classes, <tt>Host</tt> and <tt>IpAddress</tt>.  It also embeds a Neo4J server, accessible at
    <a href="http://localhost:7474">http://localhost:7474</a>.
