This sample app demonstrates link:http://isis.apache.org[Apache Isis] configured to run against link:http://neo4j.com/[Neo4J] (courtesy of Isis' integration with link:datanucleus.org[DataNucleus]).

The  app consists of just two domain entities:

image::http://yuml.me/65cb9300[link="http://yuml.me/65cb9300"]

It also embeds a Neo4J server running on port 7474; this means that we can inspect the objects as they are created.

== Screenshots

Install the fixture data from the menu using `Prototyping > Run Fixture Script`, and select the `RecreateHostsScenarioFixture`:

image::{_imagesdir}/020-fixture-prompt.png[width="800px", height="572px", link="{_imagesdir}/020-fixture-prompt.png"]

This will create a random (small) number of `Host` insatnces.  The fixture results returns links to each of these objects:

image::{_imagesdir}/030-fixture-results.png[width="800px", height="572px", link="{_imagesdir}/030-fixture-results.png"]

Each `Host` in turn has a (random, small) number of associated `IpAddress` instances.  We can inspect any one of these by following the link:

image::{_imagesdir}/040-host.png[width="800px", height="572px", link="{_imagesdir}/040-host.png"]

Now switch to the embedded Neo4J server, running on port 7474.  Click on the icon, top left:

image::{_imagesdir}/050-neo4j-embedded-server.png[width="800px", height="572px", link="{_imagesdir}/050-neo4j-embedded-server.png"]

In slides a panel.  From there we can query for all available nodes:

image::{_imagesdir}/060-neo4j-query-nodes.png[width="800px", height="572px", link="{_imagesdir}/060-neo4j-query-nodes.png"]

The graph of nodes (our `Host` and associated `IpAddress` entities) is then shown:

image::{_imagesdir}/070-view-nodes.png[width="800px", height="572px", link="{_imagesdir}/070-view-nodes.png"]

Both the `Host` and `IpAddress` entities have a `title` property, so you can use this as the label within Neo4J browser.
